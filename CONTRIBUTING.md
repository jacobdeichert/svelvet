## Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Features

Please file an issue for discussion of new features or bugs. If an existing issue already exists, please comment there instead if you have more details to provide.

If you're logging a bug, please be as detailed as possible. It's highly recommended that you post a minimum example that reproduces the problem so we can debug it more easily. Issues may be closed if you don't provide enough info.





## Submitting Pull Requests

If you're tackling a larger feature or bug, please leave a comment on the corresponding issue unless someone before you already has indicated so. If there is no issue yet, please create one so it can be discussed, before you start working on a PR. This is to save you time and energy, and to ensure we're all on the same page with the chosen solution! ðŸ™‚

Adding tests is highly recommended, though not always necessary depending on the scope of changes made.
