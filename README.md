# svelvet


An experimental svelte compiler & watcher that works with snowpack v1.


## Alternatives

Svelvet was built on top of snowpack v1. At the time, there was no easy way to get svelte and snowpack playing nicely together. That has changed however as snowpack v2 now has built-in support for svelte!

Due to this and production performance issues with esm, I don't plan on continuing to support svelvet.
